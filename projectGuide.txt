PROJECT SETTINGS
Make sure the start-up project is targeted at Ukemochi-Game project solution.
Make sure to run the MakeProject.bat (which runs the premake5 with just a double click)

REQUIRED ITEMS
- .NET desktop development (.NET Framework 4.7.2)
This is required because the project uses Dotnet 8.x.x to compile the user's scripts, without it the project will not be able to compile
the user's scripts assembly and the game may not run as intended.
